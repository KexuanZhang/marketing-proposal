# Marketing Proposal for AI school selection system

## Introduction

Our AI school selection system is designed to help students and parents make informed decisions about choosing the right school. With this system, we aim to provide personalized recommendations based on the student's preferences and academic achievements. In this proposal, we will outline a mini-marketing plan for how to start marketing and finding targeted customers for our AI school selection system, specifically for students in **University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada**.

## Step 1: Defining the target audience

The first step in marketing the AI school selection system to university students is to define the target audience. In this case, the target audience is undergraduate students who are actively searching for and considering graduate school programs. We can further divide the target customers into sub groups by similar majors. The reason for this is that there's a difference in demanding for graduate school education between different subjects. e.g. students from computer science, or accounting programs might prefer to join work force right after graduation, while students from math, physics, chemistry related program might pursue further education. Therefore, doing a pre-survey to locate student demography for high graduate school demands is essential for efficiently put into marketing resources. Coincidentally, in the UofT, similar majored students normally have courses in the same building. From there, we can: <br />
   1. Hands out some small treats in different buildings, and require students to fill out a survey form. <br />
   2. In the survey form, collects students' intention for graduate school education, knowledge of AI related tools, knowledge of school selection, their major, etc.<br />
   3. Quantify the collected responses, and identify a few targeted majors and corresponding buildings. <br />

## Step 2: Create a social media presence

Since the service is mainly chinese-student-oriented, we could promote with following media contents:<br />
    1. Upload videos on douyin/TikTok that demonstrate the usage of AI selection system.<br />
    2. Collaborate with local online influencers to post related contents, or sell school selection anxiety, and introduce our tool in the comment section.<br />
    3. Collaborate with UofT chinese student unions to advertise.<br />
    4. Advertise on the UofT confession wall. <br />

## Step 3: Attend/Organize university events

   1. Based on the target student research we did in step 1, we could set up different size of booth or consulting table in different buildings <br />
   2. Invite graduate students to share their school selection strategy, and introduce our tool. <br />
   3. Introduce the tool as limited free trials. <br />

## Conclusion

In conclusion, marketing the AI school selection system to university students requires a strategic approach. By researching on target users, creating a social media presence, attending university events, we can effectively reach our target audience and promote the benefits of our system.
